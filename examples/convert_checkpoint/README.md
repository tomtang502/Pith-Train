# Convert Checkpoint

Convert checkpoints between HuggingFace (safetensors) and PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) formats.

## Quick Start

```bash
bash examples/convert_checkpoint/launch.sh qwen3-30b-a3b
bash examples/convert_checkpoint/launch.sh deepseek-v2-lite
```

## Available Models

| Model | Operations |
|---|---|
| [Qwen3-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B) | `hf2dcp`, `dcp2hf` |
| [DeepSeek-V2-Lite](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite) | `hf2dcp`, `dcp2hf` |

Each model directory contains a `script.py` that downloads the model and runs both conversions. Edit `script.py` to customize.

## Checkpoint Layout

The DCP checkpoint is saved to `workspace/checkpoints/<model>/torch-dcp/step-XXXXXXXX`, matching the layout used by the training task. An imported HuggingFace checkpoint at `step-00000000` is directly loadable by [pretrain_language_model](../pretrain_language_model/) without any extra steps.

After training, export any step back to HuggingFace format by pointing `dcp2hf` at the corresponding `step-XXXXXXXX` directory.
